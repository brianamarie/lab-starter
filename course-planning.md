# Course planning

Let's use this document to plan the course. Later, we'll move to the `config.yml` file.

## What's the course about?

First, what is the course about? You should have decided this in the last step.

## What are the smaller steps?

You're probably breaking down what you want to teach into smaller learning objectives or steps. Here are some examples that we can use throughout the course, in case you aren't feeling very creative today.

### Course example: Writing Markdown

- Identify the file type (.md)
  - issue comment with the correct file type: `issue_comment.created`
- Write headers
  - new commit on a branch that is in a pull request: `pull_request.update`
- Write bold and italics
- Write unordered lists
- Write ordered lists
- Write links
- Include images

### Your course: <your course idea here!>

- <put the steps of your course>
- <into small units of observable behavior>
- <as list items>
- <you can reorder them later>
- <now, focus on breaking them down so they are small, and "third party observable">
- <that means things that someone can observ and verify>
- <things like write, close, assign, commit, are identifiable by watching>
- <things like understand, or know, are not something that someone can observe>
